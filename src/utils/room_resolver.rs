/// 0. IF the current room has 1 edge, direction is always AHEAD

/// 2. IF the current room has 2 edges, AND the previous room IS 0, the room direction is case 3
/// 3. IF the current room has 3 edges, the room direction is
///   1. LEFT IF `room` > all the other edges
///   2. ELSE RIGHT
/// 4. ELSE GIVEN the sorted edges, apply the following rule
///    1. the BIGGEST or the LOWEST is AHEAD
