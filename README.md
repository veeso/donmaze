## About donmaze

This was a project I started in 2022 and never finished.

It was basically an interesting experiment for making a terminal game with ratatui using a kind of isometric view.

The game actually runs and it's playable, even if I haven't managed to include every feature I wanted to.

The game is really hard to finish and it's quite boring tbh, but it was a fun project to work on.

**I highly suggest you to mute the volume** running it with `-m` flag, because the sound effects are done directly with frequencies and they are quite annoying and loud.
